			<h1>Welcome to the K@ web page!</h1>
			
			<p>My birthday is July 2 and I am a Cancer crab! I live in Newark Delaware and my favorite season is fall. I love all the colors and the crisp air! I always like to sign my name as K@ instead of Kat whenever I can!</p>
			<p>I went to the Independence School which is only 5 minutes from my house! I am currently attending Padua Academy where I am making this website in Web Page Design right now!</p>
			<p> My favorite color is pink but I also love lime green! I like strange color combinations like bright green and purple or bright blue and neon yellow! My favorite place ever is Corolla Outer Banks, where I learned to surf, and I wish I could live there! I have 2 dogs, Lucy and Daisy. I also love Iron Man, not Captain America!
