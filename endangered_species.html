			<h2>What is an Asian Tapir?</h2>
					<br />
				<p>The Asian Tapir, also known as the Malayan Tapir, is the largest of the
				five species of tapir and is the only one native to Asia. The scientific
				name of Tapirus Indicus refers to the species natural habitat, the East Indies.
				The animal can be recognized by its coloring, all black except for a light patch
				that extends from the shoulders to the tail bone. They use this pattern to convince
				predators that they are a large rock when they are sleeping. Baby tapirs usually 
				have white stripes and spots on their back that allows them to blend in with the dappled
				light of the forest. Asian tapirs usually grow to be 5 ft 11 in. up to 8 ft 2 in! 
				They have a short tail, typically 5-10 cm in length. </p>

<!-- Paragraph on habitat and their lives in general-->
			<h2>Behavior of Tapirs</h2>
					<br />
				<p> Asian Tapirs are typically solitary animals. They often mark out large plots of land as
				their territory, even though it usually overlaps with other tapir's territory. They 
				normally follow trails which they have make in the undergrowth. Tapirs are exclusively 
				herbivores and eat a variety of around 115 species of plants, however, 30 species are 
				typically preferred. They move slowly, stopping often to eat and sniff out the scents 
				of other tapirs. Even though they are bulky and move slowly, when they are threatened they
				can run swiftly or use strong jaws and sharp teeth to defend themselves. Asian tapirs
				communicate with squeaks and whistles and are often most active at night though they aren't
				exclusively nocturnal. They prefer to eat between sunset and sunrise and taking naps in
				the middle of the day. </p>

<!-- Conservation of tapirs, why they're extinct and whats being done -->
			<h2>Conservation</h2>
						<br />
				<p>Due to their large size, Asian Tapirs have few natural predators, and even killings by 
				tigers have been reported as scarce. The main threat to the Asian tapirs is human activity, 
				including deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by the damming of rivers 
				for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade. In Thailand, capture and sale of a young tapir
				may be worth around $5500. In areas such as Sumatra, where the population is mostly Muslim, 
				tapirs are seldom hunted for food, as their physical similarity to pigs has made tapir meat  
				undesired, but in some regions they are hunted for sport or shot accidentally when mistaken 
				for other animals. They have a protected status in Malaysia, Indonesia,and Thailand, where they
				seek to eliminate deliberate killing of tapirs but they do not address the issue of habitat loss, 
				and has had limited effect in reviving or maintaining the population.</p>
