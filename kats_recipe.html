			<h2><i><blocktype>These delicious pancakes are sure to get you in the Christmas spirit, year round!</blocktype></i></h2>
			
			<h1>Ingredients</h1>
				<ul><li>1 egg</li>
					<li>1 cup of flour</li>
					<li>1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
					<li>3 teaspoons of baking powder<li>
					<li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
					<li>3/4 cups of milk</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
					<li>a dash of cinnamon</li></ul>
					
			<h1>Directions</h1>
				<ol><li>In a medium bowl, beat egg with whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients until flour is moistened
				 (batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough.</li>
					<li>Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375<sup>o</sup>). (To test griddle, sprinkles with a few 
					drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray
					with cooking spray before heating).</li>
					<li>For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup of batter onto griddle. Cook 2-3 minutes or until bubbly
					on top and dry around the edges. Turn; cook other side until golden brown.</li>
					<li>Add whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon on top. For a festive touch, sprinkled crushed candy cane on top and enjoy!</li></ol>
