			<h1>Welcome to the K@ web page!</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>My birthday is July 2 and I am a Cancer crab! I live in Newark Delaware and my favorite season is 
			fall. I love all the colors and the crisp air! I always like to sign my name as <b>K@</b> instead of
			 Kat whenever I can!</p>
			<p>I went to the Independence School which is only 5 minutes from my house! I am currently attending 
			Padua Academy where I am making this website in Web Page Design right now!</p>
			<p> My favorite color is <b>pink</b> but I also love lime green! I like strange color combinations 
			like bright green and purple or bright blue and neon yellow! My favorite place ever is <b>Corolla 
			Outer Banks</b>, where I learned to surf, and I wish I could live there! I have 2 dogs, Lucy and Daisy. 
			I also love Iron Man, not Captain America! 
			<p>My favorite quote is <blockquote>"It is our choices that show who we truly are, far more than our 
			abilities"</blockquote> which is from <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, a book in my favorite
			 series.
			 <p>A few of my favorite scents!</p>
			 	<ul><li>vanilla extract</li>
			 	<li>lavender</li>
			 	<li>peppermint</li>
			 	<li>crackling bonfires</li>
			 	<li>crisp apples</li></ul>
