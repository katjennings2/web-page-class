				<h2>Reviews</h2>
					<h3>Don't take it from us, take it from the satisfied visitors!</h3>
						<p>Ann H. says: "Our tour guide, Ryan, gave us a great tour. The 
						family, the dynamics, the greed presented a perfect plot of "who 
						done it" in the Borden household. The Victorian home was interesting
						as well. A time long ago!"</p>
						<p>Jenna G. enjoyed her tour! "Our guide was Jack, he was very 
						informative not only about the house but the time era as well. The 
						house was amazing and our group was entertained the entire visit! I 
						will definitely be back!!</p>
						<p>Ellen S. and her husband had a great time! "I have always wanted 
						to go to Lizzie Borden's house - my husband, not so much. Well, we 
						went yesterday, and Sue V was our tour guide. What a fantastic tour 
						we had! Sue was knowledgeable, interesting, and very solicitous of 
						our group. She answered all our questions patiently, and let us take
						our time and look around the rooms. The hour went by so fast! Even 
						my husband was impressed!</p>
